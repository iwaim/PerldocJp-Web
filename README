        #     ./script/perldocjp_bundle_lib.pl script to install everything in
        #     ./extlib. The script (adapted from miyagawa-san's script)
        #     requires Moose, MooseX::Getopt, and YAML

        #     ./script/perldocjp_deploydb.pl \
        #           --connect_info=dbi:mysql:dbname=perldocjp \
        #           --connect_info=username \

        #
        # (2) Get the documents available from perldocjp project
        #     (this will decode the document to UTF-8 as necessary)

        #           --destination=/path/to/perldocjp
        #
        # (3) Get the current CPAN metadata information
        #     ./script/perldocjp_update_cpan.pl \
        #           --connect_info=dbi:mysql:dbname=perldocjp \
        #           --connect_info=username \
        #           --connect_info=password
        #
        # (4) Apply the source information from perldocjp and combine with
        #     the CPAN metadata
        #     ./script/perldocjp_update_metadata.pl \
        #           --pod_dir=/path/to/perldocjp/docs/modules/

        #           --connect_info=username \
        #           --connect_info=password
        #
        # you're all set. run the web server as usual

TODO
    CSS, Styling, HTML
        I (lestrrat) am NOT an HTML guy. I loathe to work with HTML.

    Better Full-Text Search
        Currently we use MySQL 5.x's REGEXP operator to maximize
        compatibility. it might be better if we created our own full-text
        index

    More Features
        Yeah, who doesn't want more features
