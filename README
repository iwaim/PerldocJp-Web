TODO
    CSS, Styling, HTML
        I (lestrrat) am NOT an HTML guy.

    Better Full-Text Search
        Currently we use MySQL 5.x's REGEXP operator to maximize
        compatibility. it might be better if we created our own full-text
        index

    More Features
        Yeah, who doesn't want more features
